  Background:
   Given there is a User
   And I am logged out

  Scenario: Unauthenticated API client gets 401 when attempting to access restricted resource

    Given I am not sending a session token in my request headers

    When I go to the json formatted children listing page

    Then I should be on the json formatted children listing page
    And I should have received a "401 Unauthorized" status code
    And I should see "no session token provided"

  Scenario: API client with invalid session token gets a 401 when attempting to access restricted resource

    Given I am sending a session token of "BAD_TOKEN" in my request headers

    When I go to the json formatted children listing page

    Then I should be on the json formatted children listing page
    And I should have received a "401 Unauthorized" status code
    And I should see "invalid session token"

  Scenario: Authenticated API client can access restricted resource

    Given I am sending a valid session token in my request headers

    When I go to the json formatted children listing page
