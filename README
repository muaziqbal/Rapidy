RapidFTR
========
RapidFTR is a mobile application that lets aid workers collect, sort and share information about children in emergency situations. RapidFTR is 
specifically designed to streamline and speed up Family Tracing and Reunification efforts both in the immediate aftermath of a crisis and during ongoing recovery efforts.

RapidFTR allows for quick input of essential data about a child on a mobile phone, including a photograph, the child's age, family, health status and location information. Data is saved automatically and uploaded to a central database whenever network access becomes available. Registered aid workers will be able to create and modify entries for children in their care as well as search all existing records in order to help distressed parents find information about their missing children. Because RapidFTR is designed specifically to collect and distribute information about children, data security is extremely important.

Initial development is focused on building an API and web interface, with subsequent development of on-phone applications for multiple mobile platforms.

Developer Info

We're working with developers from ThoughtWorks and around the version on version one of the API and Web Interface.  
You can get the source code by forking the GitHub repositories.
Please feel free to comment or contribute.  
Join the google group and read through the wikis on the main repo for how to join the project.

    RapidFTR Android Repository: 

    http://github.com/jorgej/RapidFTR-Android

RapidFTR is being developed using Ruby on Rails and CouchDB. Alongside the development of the API, 
we've also started to develop the BlackBerry client, with an Android client to follow.
If you've got experience with any of these and want to help, please get in touch.
 


Install & Run RapidFTR on OSX

To get RapidFTR running on your machine while it’s in a dev environment, you’ll need to 
install the following:
CouchDB  Ruby 1.8.6 / 1.8.7 Gems Rails 2.3.5 JSON Cucumber
You’ll also need to ‘pull’ the code from our GitHub Repository: 
http://github.com/jorgej/RapidFTR
For more details, read the official CouchDB Read Me



How To Install and Run on MAC OSX:

STEP 1:
	Download and install MacPorts 	Download and install CouchDBX

STEP 2:
	Then run these commands from Terminal or Command Line:

	Ruby: 		To check version: ‘ruby -v’ 		
        If it’s not 1.8.7, install it using macports 		
          ‘sudo port install ruby’

	Gems:  		‘sudo rake gems:install’ 		
          ‘sudo port install rb-rubygems’

	Rails: 		‘sudo rake gems:install’

	JSON: 		‘sudo gem install json’

	Cucumber: 		‘sudo gem install cucumber’

STEP 3:

	Do this once MacPorts is installed: 	‘sudo port install rb-libxml2 libxml2’  
STEP 4:

	To install your CouchDB database: 	
        From the command line, go to the folder where your GitHub repo is stored in and enter these commands: 	
        ‘rake couchdb:create’ 	
        ‘rake couchdb:create RAILS_ENV=cucumber’

	Each time a new database is committed to code (this won’t happen often) 
        you’ll have to rerun the ‘rake couchdb:create’ command.



To run RapidFTR:

From the command line, go to the folder where your GitHub repo is and enter this command: ‘./script/server’
Open CouchDBX
in a browser, go to:  
http://localhost:3000/children 
http://localhost:3000/users/

CouchDB itself should be running here: 
http://localhost:5984 

You should also be able to see the built-in database admin tool, Futon, here: 
http://localhost:5984/_utils/



Cucumber & RSPEC Tests:

To run cucumber tests, type in the command line: 
‘cucumber’ 
To run rspec tests, type in the command line: 
‘rake spec’
